There are [6 tenses & 4 moods in Sanskrit](http://sriki77-sanskrit.blogspot.in/2014/01/tenses-in-sanskrit.html). Given a word, a reader would map it to one of the tenses or moods. For beginners, it would be helpful to have an application do this mapping. This application satisfies that need.

Given a word, the application determines the mapping and highlights it. It also retrieves the corresponding धातु (Dhatu) - the root word and enlists all its tenses/mood forms.

Please take look at the app: [http://lakara.herokuapp.com/]()

Application
---------------

This is a Ruby on Rails application with Bootstrap front-end and Postgres as the database. The database stores the details of the धातु and पदम् - which is retrieved on query.

People Involved
---------------------
The concept & idea is of my teacher Sri Narasimhayya Bhat. I have implemented the initial version of this application.
